      "\n\"If unrighteousness had been effective, Ravana should have obtained the hell. You,\nendowed with virtue, would never obtain such troubles.\"",
      "\n\"Since there is absence of calamity for Ravana and misfortune occurred to you, the\nresult of vice is obtained through virtue and the result of virtue is obtained through vice. The\ncontraries of each other have changed the roles with each other.\"",

      "\n\"O tormentator of enemies! Or else, if speaking truth were indeed a virtue, our\nlying father, who was merciless to you, was disunited from you. Were you not bound by that\nannouncement made by our father regarding your installation as the Prince Regent?\"",

      "\"Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We should consider now the matter \n(of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly preoccupied.\"",
      "\"This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore less beyond. This sea is impossible to be crossed \nwithout a proper strategy.\"",
      "\"For this reason, let the military be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan \nhow this military of monkeys will reach the other shore.\"",
      "Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of Seetha, then reached the sea \nand ordered thus for the halt of the army there.",
      "\"Let all the army be stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for \nus to think about the subject of crossing the ocean.\"",
      "\"Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army. Let \nvaliant monkeys make a more and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for us.\"",
      "Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made the army to halt at the sea-shore, \nstretched with trees.",
      "That army, stationed at the vicinity of the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid \nwith yellowish white honey-coloured water.",
      "There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at the shore and settled down, \ndesiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea.",
      "While all the monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was \ndominantly heard, concealing the roar of the sea.",
      "That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three divisios (viz. 1. bears \n2. long tailed monkes and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause of Rama.",
      "That army of monkeys reached the mighty ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty \nocean being diffused by the velocity of wind.",
      "Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless and having the opposite shore \nfar off, inhabitd by a number of demons, the monkey-troups sat down there.",
      "Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators and crocodiles, that ocen with \nits foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the night, appeared to laugh and dance.",
      "The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon was reflected limitlessly in \nit. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along with whales and great fish.",
      "That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with flaming hoods, plunged \nwith mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too difficult to cross, with \nan inaccessible path, suffocationly fathomless and an abode of demons.",
      "Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and \nfell whipped into motion by the breeze.",
      "Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful abode of enemies \nof gods forever, the sea reaches upto the uneven Patala (subterranean region).",
      "The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked \nalike without any distinction.",
      "The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water. Filled with stars above and \nthe pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same splendour.",
      "There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of \nthe sky with a row of falling clouds.",
      "The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a terrific resonance, sounded \nlike a kettle-drum in the sky.",
      "Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds, resonating with abundance of \nprecious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of hurricane, filled with a number of \naquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly murmuring waves.",
      "The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving, full \nof resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro."
